# Particle Swarm Optimisation Algorithm

This is my final year dissertation project at Brighton University in which I undertook further research into Dr Nour Ali's [Particle Swarm Algorithm](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/188254379.pdf).

The project was done in Android Studio SDK so that I can test on mobile devices. More information can be found [here](https://folio.brighton.ac.uk/user/azhar-islam/pso-ui).
